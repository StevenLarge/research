In order to get the outputs to write in the correct place you need directories:

Output
AutoCorrelation

The primary files to run are:

WorkVariancePrimary.py. -> This runs a constant velocity protocol for a number of different protocol times and find the variance in all of the works calculated

FrictionTestPrimary -> This simulates a trajectory at a fixed control parameter value and then finds the friction tensor (both the generalized friction and the new metric)
