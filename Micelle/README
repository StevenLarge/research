	Notes for correlation program

	This program calculates the correlation function between two variables where the data (.dat) files are of the format:

	step	value
	0		x1
	1		x2
	2		x3
	.		.
	.		.
	.		.

	where the titles are not part of the file and the values are of type double.
	
	Input parameters are contained in the correlation_input file:

******************************INPUT PARAMETERS****************************************

	input_1			-->	This is the first input file
	input_2			--> This is the second input file
	
	start_time		--> This is the point in the data file where the calculation of the correlation begins (so if there is an initial equilibration, this can be neglected)
	end_time		--> The point in the data point where the program stops calculating the averages
	
	tau_time		--> The length of time steps over which the correlation is calculated
	
	output_file		--> This outputs a data file with two columns, the correlation time (in the first column) and the correlation value (in the second column)
	
*******************************NOTES***********************************************
	
	-To calculate the autocorrelation function of a parameter, just put the same input file for both input_1 and input_2
	
	-The output file is given as corr.exe after the Makefile
